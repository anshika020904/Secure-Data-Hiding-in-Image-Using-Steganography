## Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a method for securely hiding secret messages within digital images using a substitution-based steganography technique. By subtly altering specific pixel values, the project embeds confidential data into an image while preserving its overall appearance. This approach ensures that the hidden message remains undetectable to unauthorized viewers.

# Features
Data Concealment: Embeds secret messages within image pixels without altering visual quality.
Dual Functionality: Offers both encoding (hiding) and decoding (extracting) capabilities.
Preservation of Image Quality: The embedding process maintains the original image's appearance.
Ease of Integration: A straightforward method that can be easily incorporated into other projects.

# Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.
Pillow (PIL): Utilized for image processing tasks.
NumPy: Employed for efficient manipulation of image pixel data.

# How to Use
To encode a secret message, the project reads an input image, embeds the confidential data, and generates a new image that conceals the message. To decode the hidden message, the project processes the steganographic image to extract and reveal the concealed data. Detailed instructions are provided within the project's documentation.

# Future Enhancements
Enhanced Security: Integration of additional encryption layers (e.g., AES) for increased security.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Development of a user-friendly interface for easier operation.
Extended Media Support: Expansion to include video and audio steganography.
Robustness Improvements: Refinements to better resist steganalysis and detection techniques.
